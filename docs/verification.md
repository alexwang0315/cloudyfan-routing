# Initial extraction verification — 2026-10-18

Verified locally on macOS with CPython 3.13.13:

- `uv sync --extra dev`: independent virtual environment and locked dependencies installed.
- `uv run pytest -q`: **205 passed**. Tests prohibit real socket connections; all API evidence is synthetic MockTransport data.
- `uv run ruff check .`: passed (F rules).
- Offline demos: pass = 1 mock request / 0 classifiers; low = 3 / 1; mid = 4 / 2; high = 4 / 2. All final public validators passed.
- `uv build`: source distribution and wheel built. Both exclude runtime, workspaces, credentials and receipt directories.
- Wheel installed in a separate virtual environment, run from `/tmp` with Python isolated mode and no PYTHONPATH: high-path demo passed. No dependency on the original workspace package.
- All 10 original source-file hashes recorded in `provenance.json` remain unchanged.

Extraction review found and fixed two new orchestration/accounting edge cases, with regression tests:

1. A completed workflow now rejects a reconciled receipt whose model/provider no longer matches its admitted profile.
2. A duplicate generation whose call ID sorts before the original no longer hides the original known charge. The duplicate remains unresolved, and no trusted grand total is fabricated.

Malformed tool invocations stop as engineering failures with preserved billable evidence. `ledger.summarize` includes incomplete intents and failures even when no completed workflow exists.

No paid API request was made for extraction, validation, review or repository creation. These checks do not establish new routing savings, production deployment, Windows support or new model qualification. CI is configured for macOS/Linux and Python3.12/3.13 but has not run on a remote host.
